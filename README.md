My solution to the [Random User Challenge](https://github.com/kentcdodds/random-user-challenge) thrown down by Mr. Kent C Dodds!

## Install

* Clone to your target folder
* npm install
	- ignore scary looking node compile errors
* type "gulp watch" to start server
* browse to localhost:8080, and have fun!
